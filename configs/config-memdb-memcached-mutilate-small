### Mutilate is a load generate for memcached that is meant to generate high
### request rates that are realistic. It is not an optimal configuration
### as that would require multiple server instances but it is a reasonable
### test of a single node. It can also be used to simulate specific loads
### but this configuration uses the defaults until such time as the basic
### problems are resolved.
