### This is Andrea Arcangeli's autonuma synthetic benchmark that stresses
### some NUMA effects but is not intended to represent any real workload as
### such. Very broadly speaking there are 4 benchmarks of interest.
###
### NUMA01
###   Two processes
###   NUMCPUSS/2 number of threads so all CPUs are in use
###
###   On startup, the process forks
###   Each process mallocs a 3G buffer but there is no communication
###       between the processes.
###   Threads are created that zeros out the full buffer 1000 times
###
###   The objective of the test is that initially the two processes
###   allocate their memory on the same node. As the threads are
###   are created the memory will migrate from the initial node to
###   nodes that are closer to the referencing thread.
###
###   It is worth noting that this benchmark is specifically tuned
###   for two nodes and the expectation is that the two processes
###   and their threads split so that all process A runs on node 0
###   and all threads on process B run in node 1
###
###   With 4 and more nodes, this is actually an adverse workload.
###   As all the buffer is zeroed in both processes, there is an
###   expectation that it will continually bounce between two nodes.
###
###   So, on 2 nodes, this benchmark tests convergence. On 4 or more
###   nodes, this partially measures how much busy work automatic
###   NUMA migrate does and it'll be very noisy due to cache conflicts.
###
### NUMA01_THREADLOCAL
###   Two processes
###   NUMCPUSS/2 number of threads so all CPUs are in use
###
###   On startup, the process forks
###   Each process mallocs a 3G buffer but there is no communication
###       between the processes
###   Threads are created that zero out their own subset of the buffer.
###       Each buffer is 3G/NR_THREADS in size
###
###   This benchmark is slightly better. In an ideal situation, each
###   thread will migrate its data to its local node. The test really
###   is to see does it converge and how quickly.
###
### NUMA02
###  One process, NR_CPU threads
###
###  On startup, malloc a 1G buffer
###  Create threads that zero out a thread-local portion of the buffer.
###       Zeros multiple times - the number of times is fixed and seems
###       to just be to take a period of time
###
###  This is similar in principal to NUMA01_THREADLOCAL except that only
###  one process is involved. I think it was aimed at being more JVM-like.
###
### NUMA02_SMT
###  One process, NR_CPU/2 threads
###
###  This is a variation of NUMA02 except that with half the cores idle it
###  is checking if the system migrates the memory to two or more nodes or
###  if it tries to fit everything in one node even though the memory should
###  migrate to be close to the CPU
