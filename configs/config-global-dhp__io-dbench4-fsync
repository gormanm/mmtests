### DBench 4 (https://dbench.samba.org/) is a workload generator that was
### originally designed for network filesystems but can run on any filesystem.
### It is intended as a stress tool to detect where the saturation point is.
### The results can be tricky to interpret as it cycles through a load file
### and the results partially depend on where in the loadfile the benchmark
### was when the time runs out. This configuration uses fsync after the IO
### completes (-F switch to the benchmark specifically) and varies the number
### of clients up to NUMCPUS*8.
###
### This is a modified version of the benchmark to reduce variation. The
### filesystem is limited in size to offset variations due to disk
### placement of inodes. Work files are deleted between runs to further
### reduce noise from disk placement. A smaller version of the loadfile
### is used to minimise variances due to loadfiles being partially
### completed. The metric reported is time to complete execution as
### throughput is difficult to interpret when different operations take
### different amounts of time.
