### NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that visually represents
### the network performance under a variety of conditions. It performs simple
### ping-pong tests, bouncing messages of increasing size between two processes,
### whether across a network or within an SMP system. Message sizes are chosen
### at regular intervals, and with slight perturbations, to provide a complete
### test of the communication system. Each data point involves many ping-pong
### tests to provide an accurate timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing
### the round trip time in half for small messages ( < 64 Bytes ).
