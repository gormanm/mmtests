### Seeker was added due to a bug report based on the benchmark posted at
### http://www.linuxinsight.com/how_fast_is_your_disk.html . Ultimately it
### turned out there was not a bug in the kernel but the benchmark was
### flawed. This version is patched to support read/write benchmarks,
### tests on either files or block devices and addresses some problems with
### the random numbers generated. The most important change is that
### posix_fadvise is used to discard blocks after reading so that it's really
### measuring IO and not page cache and the write benchmark uses
### sync_file_range to ensure the write to disk actually happens. The benchmark
### is not really indicative of anything but remains popular for some reason.
###
### This configuration is a read-write benchmark of a block device.
